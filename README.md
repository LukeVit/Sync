Search engine for song to DJ

<h4>Background / Problem</h4>
<p>
As a Dj, I often find myself wanting to find songs that fit the key, tempo, and energy of the current songs I am mixing, but I have that gap in my current library that I can't find that one track that fits.

Some of the major factors that make this problem hard to solve are the time is takes to find the right music, not alot of catalogs have information about tracks (BPM, KEY, etc...), and many platforms have a limited selection of music.
</p>

<h4>Resources available</h4>
<p>
Spotify's Web API offers a promising catalog of songs (with descriptions) that can be searched by various attributes. The API is accessible on a free basis and has a vast selection of music.
</p>

<h4>Aim of project</h4>
<p>
Produce a solution that helps utilise Spotify's API to access their vast catalog and also help bridge the gap to find the right song that fits while I Dj.
